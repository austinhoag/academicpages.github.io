The successful landing of NASA's Perserverance rover yesterday marks the fifth chapter in NASA's rover missions, which began in the late 1990s. None of these missions could have been possible without the Mars orbiters, which NASA and the Soviet Union started sending as far back as the 1970s. NASA has used the orbiters to map the surface of Mars in extreme detail, allowing them to find optimal sites for the rovers to land and then explore. While the orbiters enable the rover missions via their imagery, they are also interesting in their own right. They generate the most detailed images that humanity has captured of another planet. Until I started looking at these images, I really did not appreciate how diverse and rich the Martian surface is. 

The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Reconnaissance_Orbiter">Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter</a> contains HiRISE (High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment), the "most powerful camera ever sent to another planet," according to the <a href="https://www.uahirise.org/epo/about/">instrument homepage</a>. The camera images Mars at extremely high resolution (< 1 meter/pixel) and has been taking data since 2006. The team also makes a significant investment in making their high quality image data public.
