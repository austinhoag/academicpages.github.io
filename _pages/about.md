<p> I am a Machine Learning Engineer at <a href="https://existence.org/">Berkeley Existential Risk Initiative (BERI)</a>. I am the lead engineer for the <a href="https://github.com/seldonian-framework"> Seldonian Machine Learning library</a>, which will provide ML researchers and practitioners a way to implement <a href="http://aisafety.cs.umass.edu/overview.html">Seldonian algorithms</a>. These algorithms provide a way to enforce safety and fairness constraints in ML algorithms. </p>

<p>Previously, I was a Software Developer at the Princeton Neuroscience Institute at Princeton University. I developed applications for data analysis and visualization of terabyte-scale neuroscience imaging datasets. I created a web blog while working at Princeton where I shared demos of some of these software tools: <a href="https://brainmaps.princeton.edu">BrainMaps</a>. </p>

<p>
Before becoming a software developer, I was a postdoctoral researcher in astrophysics at UCLA. I studied the first galaxies in the universe and the imprint they left on the universe in a process known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reionization">reionization</a>. During my PhD and Postdoc, I developed an image analysis pipeline for detecting and classifying galaxies in large space-based imaging datasets. My research has been featured in press releases from <a href="http://www.keckobservatory.org/recent/entry/faintest_early_universe_galaxy_ever_detected_and_confirmed"> Keck Observatory</a> and <a href="https://www.space.com/36441-ultra-distant-galaxy-is-exceptionally-unexceptional.html">Space.com</a>.
</p>

<p> I published a side project in a <a href="/year-archive">Blog Post</a> where I used Convolutional Neural Networks to automatically detect surface features of interest in satellite images of the Martian surface.</p>
