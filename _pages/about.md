<p> I am an Imaging Product Software Developer at the Princeton Neuroscience Institute at Princeton University. I develop applications for data analysis and visualization of terabyte-scale neuroscience imaging datasets. My current software stack is: Docker, Python (Flask), MySQL, Javascript, HTML, CSS. My open-source work is shared at <a href="https://www.github.com/austinhoag">www.github.com/austinhoag</a>. I have a Princeton web blog where I share demos of some of my work-related software tools: <a href="https://brainmaps.princeton.edu">BrainMaps</a>. </p>

<p> In my spare time, I have been working on a project to use Convolutional Neural Networks to automatically detect surface features of interest in satellite images of the Martian surface. I have written up my progress so far in a <a href="/year-archive">Blog Post</a>. 

<p>
Before becoming a software developer, I was a postdoctoral researcher in astrophysics at UCLA. I studied the first galaxies in the universe and the imprint they left on the universe in a process known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reionization">reionization</a>. During my PhD and Postdoc, I developed an image analysis pipeline for detecting and classifying galaxies in terabyte-scale space-based imaging datasets. My research has been featured in press releases from <a href="http://www.keckobservatory.org/recent/entry/faintest_early_universe_galaxy_ever_detected_and_confirmed"> Keck Observatory</a> and <a href="https://www.space.com/36441-ultra-distant-galaxy-is-exceptionally-unexceptional.html">Space.com</a>.
